Find the Frequency
Given a vector of N positive integers and an integer X. The task is to find the frequency of X in vector.


N = 5
arr = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
x -> 5
Output :- 5

arr = {2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3}
x -> 3
Output -> 4
	int count = 0;
	for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
		if(x == arr[i])
			count++;
	}	
	return count;
