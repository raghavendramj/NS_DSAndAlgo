Medium/Hard :-
	Sum of GCD of all numbers upto N with N itself
	N= 3
	GCD of [1, 3] = 1,
	GCD of [2, 3] = 1, 
	GCD of [3, 3] = 3, 
	--------------------
	Sum  => 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
	--------------------
	

Easy :-
	Find GCD or HCF of two numbers
	GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) or HCF (Highest Common Factor) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them. 

36 -> 2 * 2 * 3 * 3
60 -> 2 * 2 * 3 * 5
--------------------
2 * 2 * 3 => 12

GCD(60, 32) = 12
