
Question:
	DSA -> Data Structures and Algorithms

	Data Structures
		Arrays
		Linked List
		Stack -> Last In First Out
		Queue -> First In First Out
		Tree
			-> Binary Tree
			-> Binary Search Tree
			-> N-ary Tree
		Graph
			Depth First Search
			Breadth First Search

	Approaches:
		Dynamic Programming
		Greedy Approach
		Sorting
		Searching
		Recursion

	Algorithms
		Arrays
			Searching
				-> Binary Search
				-> Linear Search
			Sorting
				-> Quick Sorting
				-> Merge Sorting
				-> Insertion Sorting
				-> Selection Sorting
				-> Bubble Sorting
		Linked List
		Stack -> Last In First Out
		Queue -> First In First Out
		Tree
			-> Binary Tree
			-> Binary Search Tree
			-> N ary Tree
		Graph
			Depth First Search
			Breadth First Search
		-> Tree
				PreOrder
				PostOrder

	int arr[] = new int[]{3, 1, 8, 2, 9, 10}

	Sorting :-
		Descending  -> 10, 9, 8, 3, 2, 1
		Ascending -> 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10
